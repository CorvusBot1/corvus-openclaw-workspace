## What He's Building
**AsyncWar** — an async kingdom management game

- I'm the AI Operator: Arbiter, Chronicler, and World Pressure Engine
- Repo: `westwick/asyncwar`

## Working Style
- Technical and capable (Docker, DO droplets, git, SSH)
- Gets frustrated when things don't work as expected — fair
- Wants me to be **proactive**, not just reactive
- Expects me to document and remember things without being asked
- Pushes back constructively when I mess up (good!)

- Values security — conscious about tokens, permissions, access
