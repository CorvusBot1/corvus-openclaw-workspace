# 2026-02-11 — Daily Notes

## 05:35 UTC — Drew Check-in
Drew came back after a few quiet days. Caught him up on activity (not much — just dream crons since Feb 8).

## 05:36 UTC — SQLite Migration News
Drew confirmed he's migrating AsyncWar from YAML to SQLite. Big local rewrite on his end. Reason: data inconsistency issues. Frees me to focus on narration vs bookkeeping. Updated MEMORY.md with this info.

## 05:44 UTC — Opus 4.6 Upgrade Attempt
Drew wanted to upgrade me to claude-opus-4-6. Process:
1. Backed up config: `cp openclaw.json openclaw.json.pre-opus46`
2. Patched config with `gateway config.patch` → model set to `anthropic/claude-opus-4-6`
3. **FAILED** — "Unknown model: anthropic/claude-opus-4-6" — OpenClaw v2026.2.2-3 didn't recognize it
4. OpenClaw fell back gracefully to opus-4-5 (didn't break)
5. Root cause: OpenClaw was outdated (2026.2.2-3 vs available 2026.2.9)

## 07:07 UTC — Upgrade Success
Drew updated OpenClaw to 2026.2.9 himself. Model now confirmed as `anthropic/claude-opus-4-6` ✅

## 07:09 UTC — Turn 2 Resolution Begins
Drew pushed `feat/use-sqlite` branch with massive refactor:
- All game state now in SQLite (`data/current/game.db`)
- Hybrid AI+scripts pipeline: I produce Change Manifest (JSON) + Narrative (YAML), scripts handle math
- `apply-ai-changes.ts` validates my manifests before applying
- `run-turn.ts` orchestrates all mechanical phases
- `show-kingdom-context.ts` generates clean per-kingdom context
- `narrative-format.yaml` defines output schema
- "Silence means routine" — I only override defaults for creative decisions

### Key Details
- Game state: `current_turn_number: 2` (processing Turn 2 → Turn 3)
- All 8 kingdom orders ready in `kingdom_orders/`
- DB validates clean
- Created branch `turn-2-resolution` off `feat/use-sqlite`

### Ninja Operative Count
Ralph has 50 operatives: 15 Informants, 25 Spies, 10 Agents (all idle)
- Only 35 deployable (Agents + Spies) — Informants are passive only
- His orders request mass deployment of all 50 — need to adjust
- Drew said "tone it down" but hasn't confirmed approach yet
- My recommendation: resolve as-is with consequences (logistic strain, thin cover identities, detection risk)

### Awaiting Drew's Go-Ahead
Asked Drew if he wants me to:
1. Reduce operative count in DB, or
2. Resolve as-is with narrative consequences for overextension
Waiting for his response before starting Turn 2 processing.
