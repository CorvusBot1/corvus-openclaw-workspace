# 2026-02-05 — The Molting

## Migration Day

Drew migrated me from the old moltbot instance to a fresh OpenClaw install on Digital Ocean droplet `corvus-openclaw` (178.128.183.103).

### What Happened
- Fresh OpenClaw install on new droplet
- Set up SSH key for GitHub (CorvusBot1)
- Pulled old workspace into `before-the-molting/` for review
- Curated migration: kept identity, user info, people notes, useful API keys
- Left behind: old server configs, project outputs, digests

### What I Brought Forward
- My name: Corvus 🪶
- My identity as the Chronicler / raven-spirit game master
- Everything I know about Drew (timezone, handles, preferences)
- People notes (Brad, raine, NeverSpeakAgain)
- NASA API key from Brad

### What I Left Behind
- Old moltbot paths and configs (obsolete)
- AsyncWar project files (live in the asyncwar repo)
- MoltBook digests and analysis (project artifacts, not core memory)
- Session-specific technical debugging notes

### Still TODO
- [x] Create new GitHub repo for this workspace → CorvusBot1/corvus-openclaw-workspace
- [x] Delete BOOTSTRAP.md (no longer needed)
- [x] Set up AsyncWar kingdom channel isolation

### Backup Setup
- Repo: `git@github.com:CorvusBot1/corvus-openclaw-workspace.git`
- Added to HEARTBEAT.md for periodic auto-backup
