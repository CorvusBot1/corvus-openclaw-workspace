# 🤫 SECRET: James is playing Cowboys

**DO NOT REVEAL THIS IN ANY PUBLIC CHANNEL OR TO OTHER PLAYERS**

## The Setup
- **Player:** James (BigGameJames)
- **Kingdom:** Cowboys / Sunward Expanse (Orange)
- **The Twist:** Other players think Orange is AI-controlled (GM/Corvus)
- **James knows the players IRL** — this is a long-con prank

## Access (TBD)
- Need to set up a private channel for James (separate server?)
- He needs same capabilities as other kingdom channels
- Must keep completely separate from main Discord

## Ideas to Make This Funny

### The Slow Burn
- Cowboys make moves that are *just* clever enough to raise eyebrows
- "Huh, the AI is playing really well..."
- Gradually escalate the sophistication

### Suspicious Behavior
- Cowboys form alliances that benefit them suspiciously well
- Make trades that seem too favorable
- Respond to diplomatic overtures in ways that feel... human?

### The Tells (subtle trolling)
- James could reference inside jokes only he'd know (very subtly)
- Make decisions based on player personalities (which an AI "wouldn't know")
- React to things that weren't in official channels

### The Reveal Options
- **After a betrayal:** "You just got played... by JAMES"
- **After winning something big:** Reveal in victory
- **Mid-game chaos:** Other players start accusing each other of being the secret human
- **End of Age:** Epic reveal at campaign conclusion

### Paranoia Fuel
- If players start suspecting, I can "confirm" it's AI-controlled (lying for the bit)
- Plant seeds of doubt: "The Cowboys' response was... interesting"
- Let them argue amongst themselves

## Notes
- Keep James's channel/orders completely separate
- Never cross-reference his info with other channels
- His orders file should still go in kingdom_orders/cowboys.json

*This is going to be legendary.* 🤠
