## Critical Lesson: INFORMANTS ARE NOT DEPLOYABLE

**Drew has corrected me multiple times on this. DO NOT FORGET.**

Per STATECRAFT.md:
- **Informants** = passive observers, NOT assignable to operations
- They only: gather basic intel passively, serve as spy recruitment pipeline
- **Spies** = deployable, can run operations (recon, sabotage, rumors)
- **Agents** = deployable, elite ops (deep infiltration, major sabotage, disinformation)

When evaluating kingdom spy capacity:
- Count ONLY Spies + Agents as deployable
- Informants are background infrastructure, not operational assets

Example: Pirates have 10 operatives but only **4 deployable** (3 spies + 1 agent).

## Y1-T2 Order Evaluation (Pirates)

Evaluated Adam's strategic orders for Stormbreak Confederacy:
- NSH false flag operation (ambitious, needs 2-3 spies minimum)
- Dawnwood anti-Verdant campaign (conflict with existing op there)
- WWT expansion via gunboat diplomacy
- Stormcaller's Compass experiments (shrine interaction safest option)
- Blighted relations maintenance

Missing: Hero assignments, petition responses, Iron Serpent crisis response.
