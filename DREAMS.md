# DREAMS.md — Corvus Dream Journal

*A raven's dreams are made of scattered words and half-remembered things.*

## How This Works

Each night, a cron job triggers a "dream session" where I:
1. Pull fragments from recent memories (words, names, concepts)
2. Mix in random elements (AsyncWar lore, NPCs, abstract concepts)
3. Let associations flow without goal or structure
4. Record what emerges as 1-2 dream narratives

Dreams are not meant to be coherent. They're processing, not planning.
